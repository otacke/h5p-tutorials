00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.050
Hey everybody! My name is Oliver and
you're watching the first of hopefully

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.279
many videos about H5P that I am creating
and today I'd like to answer the

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.560
question: "What is H5P?" So, if you already
know the answer to that feel free to

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.579
skip this video, but if you don't, hang in
a second - well probably 5 to 10 minutes -

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:33.579
and we'll see. So, what you see is
the website of H5P that you can find at

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:40.780
h5p.org and it says: create, share
and reuse interactive html5 content in

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.280
your browser - which is pretty abstract,
right? Luckily, there's a section

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.829
called "examples and downloads" and I can
use it to show you what H5P is instead

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:58.239
of answering the question what H5P is.
It looks like this and contains a list

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.789
of so-called content types which together form H5P, and I will not show you

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:08.950
everything in detail, but I'll have a
look at, yeah, probably 3 content types and

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.010
we could start with "dialog cards" maybe.
This is it.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.190
Um, if you learn a language you will
probably know the technique of using

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.380
flashcards where you write a word on
top of a flashcard and the translation

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.390
at the back side of the flashcard and
then you have a look at the word and try

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.940
to guess or to know the correct
translation. And you can do that as well.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.020
Maybe you're a teacher you could create
a deck of flashcards here, but you have

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.080
many many more options in contrast to
paper flashcards. So, as you can see, you

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.720
can add an image which is pretty nice,
and we also have a button which can play

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.360
a sound sample. So, if I click it, it
should read "ArÃ¡ndanos azules" I

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:04.810
don't know, I don't speak Spanish.
Let's hear ... OK, not even close, but luckily

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.509
I know that those are blueberries and we
can turn the card ... and they are

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.280
blueberries. And you can go over to the
next card and the next card ... And as

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.570
teacher, you could for example create a
deck of several cards that your students

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.260
can use to learn a language.
And if you wonder: "Okay, I can't award points

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.180
and students don't have to enter the
correct translation." - there's also a

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.570
content type which can do that which is
called flashcards. And I invite you to

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.600
have a look at that yourself.
I'll head back to the list of content types.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.560
And which should we have a look at next? Yeah,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:54.990
let's take "image hotspots". This one which is probably my favorite content type

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:01.080
although it's pretty simple actually. You
can add an image in the background and

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.290
then you can you define some hotspots over here. And if you click on them you get

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.860
some more information. Right here, a
window swipes in from the right and

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:21.840
contains some text. Oh, yeah, this is better.
Yeah, so as you can see these windows can

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.040
also contain videos and you could also
put more text on top if you like to - or

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.160
maybe images. That's possible and you can really use it, this content type, for

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.959
giving great presentations
which is really cool. Well let's head

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:45.090
back to the example page ... and now we'll
have a look at the most famous content type

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:52.140
which is called "interactive video".
Let's have a look. If you've taken some

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.209
online courses lately, you'll probably
have seen something like that, but maybe

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:03.450
we should just hit that play button here
below and see what happens. The video

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.050
starts, of course ... Something pops up but I'll skip that.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:17.000
I'll wait for next one ... which says multiple choice quiz. And obviously we can put

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.979
multiple choice quizzes on top of
videos with H5P. So, there's a

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.550
strawberry. We can check that and it's
correct.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.229
Let's continue. And we can jump to the
next one

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:36.290
actually. It's similar, like a
multiple-choice quiz, I guess. I can see

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.330
blueberries and I know that was a
strawberry before, so it's probably

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:48.340
correct and it is and we can continue ...
and we can also jump to the third one

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:55.120
which is called "fill in the blanks" and
that's a cloze. So we have to type in

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.770
the correct solution which will be
blueberries in this case and we'll, yeah

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.620
we'll stick with that. We check. As you
can see we could try again because the

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.120
solution was not completely correct and
we could have a look at the solution and

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.930
as a teacher, we have many options that
we can configure to adapt the content type

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.240
to our needs. For example, what should happen if I answer incorrectly? Should I go back

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.680
to the start of the video? Should I go to
a different position? All that's possible.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.960
Well, I guess that's stuff for three other
videos which I might creat, but not

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.229
right now. So, we were ... Let's stop that. And, oh, maybe we could go back to this page

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:48.260
just to see the examples. So, now
you've seen what H5P is, but why should

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.970
you use it and what are your benefits?
And I can only give you my top five

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:59.360
reasons. Other people may have others, but yeah, let's let's go. First of all, it is

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.949
really easy to use. As a student I don't
have to read a manual to interact with

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:07.970
those content types to answer the
quizzes and questions. And also as a

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.270
teacher I don't have to read a manual to
create those. It's really really simple ...

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:18.820
most of the time. H5P is free to use, so
you really don't have to pay anything -

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.020
not even as a company. You can create
stuff with H5P and include it in your

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:28.180
products and you don't have to pay
royalties or anything like that, which is

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:34.090
probably pretty cool for you if you're a
company. Then, H5P is not only free to

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:39.820
use, but it's open to use, because it's
open-source software. So if you could

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.300
code a little bit like myself, then you
can have a look at the source code and

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.070
change it to your needs, and you can also
contribute to the development of new

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.660
features and content types which is
really nice because it makes H5P kind of

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.760
a community project and, yeah, that
differentiates it a little bit from

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.620
commercial products, I guess. Then, my
reason number four is: You really don't

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.690
have to install any special software on
your computer. You just need a browser and

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:12.370
this is valid for desktop systems and
mobile systems as well. So, you can use

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.810
maybe Chrome on your desktop browser and you can also use Safari

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:23.410
on your iPhone or whatever and it works. So, you can create content once and it runs

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:28.600
anywhere which is pretty cool. And
finally, my reason number five is:

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.740
You can take H5P where you need it. So,
you can create stuff here on this

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:39.400
website if you like to, but you can also
get a plugin for a moodle, WordPress or

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:45.160
Drupal and install it there, you can use it
there, and it doesn't matter where you

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.300
create content. You can embed it
elsewhere, so you can create it here for

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.890
example, and take it then to an HTML page and embed the stuff there, so you

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:58.300
don't even see this page. And you can
download the content, maybe from this

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.290
system and then you go to your moodle
system where you have the plugin, upload it there

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:06.520
and use it there. And you don't have to
change anything which is really great. So,

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:13.090
um, I think I'm close to my my ten
minutes limit, so let's wrap it up for

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:18.760
today. I hope you like H5P, um, maybe you
just head over here to h5p.org, give it a

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:24.400
shot, and yeah, that's it. And also, if you
like, you can watch my videos, maybe

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.110
subscribe to this channel. I'm going to
create some more tutorials and, yeah,

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:35.880
related videos and stuff. But anyway. Enjoy H5p! Take care. Bye-bye!
