Hey everybody! This is Oliver and you are
watching a brief tutorial on how to

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:18.800
create something like this which is
called image hotspots in H5P. But before

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.470
we have a look at how we create
something like this,

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.029
let's have a look at some real world
examples first. This example is taken

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.559
from an online course about Danish and
German history and down here we have the

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:35.780
image hotspot and we can go to full
screen and we can see a map which shows

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.170
some information about the results of a
referendum where people had to decide

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.600
whether they want to be Danes or Germans.
And, yeah, as you expect we can click on

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:52.159
the hotspots. And some image pops up, and some information pops up, yeah.

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:57.199
Pretty basic use. And I have one more
example which might be more interesting

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.030
for you, so let's have a look at that.
This is it and I think it is a pretty

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.440
inventive use of image hotspots in H5P
and it was actually created by a

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.330
colleague of mine called Anja Lorenz, um, she had to give a talk at a

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.899
conference and she thought: "Maybe we can do something a little different today"

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.689
and she came up with this, but of course
we should go to the full screen first.

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:26.390
And this may remind you of Jeopardy - the game show - and you're absolutely right.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.520
So, Anja said: "I have so much to talk about, but we don't have the time, so why don't

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.079
you choose what you're interested in,
maybe OER which is short for open

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:42.409
educational resources and then you just
give me a number, maybe hundred", and yeah

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.719
so you would say "OER 100" and I
know it's okay, let's look what's behind

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:52.549
that and she would click on that hot spot
and in this case a window would pop up

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:58.310
which contains a short video, yeah, I guess she just played it and explained it a

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.369
little bit afterwards, so when that was
done people could say: "Okay, now let's say OER 300"

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:11.300
maybe, and yeah, this is about H5P,
and I guess she explained how we use it on

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.320
our platform, and yeah, that's it, that's what I wanted to show you. It's pretty

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.700
inventive as I said, yeah, but
let's head back and see how we can

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.830
create something like that ... And we're
back at h5p.org. So, on top

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.280
you can log into your account over here
and there you have a button which is labeled

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:39.120
"Create new content" and if you click on
that the H5P Hub opens where you can choose the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.760
type of content that you want to create. In
our case it's image hotspots. We use that

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.720
one and we can give it a title and I'll
call it "cat and dog". Typically you

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.810
start with adding a background image
which is this button here, and I have an

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:05.069
image of a cat and a dog luckily, so we
can add that. And you should always fill

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.599
out this field because it's used by
blind people or the screen readers that

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:15.000
blind people use, which tells them what
the image shows, so we can add a little

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:24.120
description here ... and then we can choose a hotspot color. Yeah, maybe we use

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.739
something blue-ish. Let's take that
and then we can start to

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.930
add our content. So, you can click on the
center of the dog, for example, and say:

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.410
"Okay, I want my my hotspot there" and
yeah let's give it a title. Let's call it

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:47.750
"DOG" and then we can add our content and we can choose between text video and

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:55.940
images. Yeah, let's start with with a brief text

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:05.010
and when we have our text we can also
add something else, maybe, maybe we want an

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.510
image and of course I have one of a dog
as well over here.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:16.859
I chose a husky because I like them. And
again you should fill all this alternative

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.970
text field so blind people know what
the image is showing. So, let's do that.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.039
Okay, this one's similar. This is the
hover text which, you know, when you hover

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:34.919
over an item it may show what's inside.
Let's skip that and we'll choose another

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:42.180
hotspot and of course we now want to do
one for the cat. So we click on the cat

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:49.229
or, yeah, maybe, well, you put it on the
nose of the cat, um, and we can get the

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:56.039
header again. Then we can decide that in
this case the hotspot should cover or

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:00.210
... the window that pops up
when the hotspot is clicked should cover

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:06.660
the entire background image. So, let's
check that one. And now we add the video

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:21.270
and, of course, I prepared ... I chose the
video up front. And this ... but let's, let's

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.870
have a look what this video shows. And
you have some more options, like you can

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.360
configure it ... This is about the video
player -- how it looks. And here you can

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:37.979
choose if the video should autoplay or
loop, yeah. Accessibility might be

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:43.919
interesting, because you can add captions
if you like to. The YouTube video might

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:49.680
have them, I'm not sure. I'll have a look
at it surely. But let's, um, save our

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.849
creation and take a look.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:02.240
That's what we created. That is our
content type, our image hotspot. So, let's

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.910
go to full screen which is always nicer
and if we click here, we should see this

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.710
one. As we typed it in: "Dog" as the header, "This is a dog" as text

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:18.080
description and below the image of the
husky. And if we click here, we'll get our

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:25.790
video and as we wanted it, it's covering
the whole screen. So, yeah, let's have a

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:32.470
look at the cats for a brief period.
Here it is. Okay

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:38.090
Cats are nice. Anyway, I hope you liked
this video and if you did, have a look at

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.980
my channel where you can find more
videos about H5P, um, yeah, well, what's

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.890
left to say? Enjoy H5P! Take care.
Bye-bye.
