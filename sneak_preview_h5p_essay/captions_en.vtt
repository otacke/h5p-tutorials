Hey everybody! My name is Oliver and
you're watching one of my videos about

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:22.140
H5P and today I'd like to show you this.
This is what I've been working on for the

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.500
last couple of days and it's going to
become a content type for H5P

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.489
and I called it H5P Essay, because it's
intended to be something like that.

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.320
You give students a task and they have to
become productive and write texts. So, for

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.690
example right here my task is to
summarize "The Hobbit" So let's see if I

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.710
can do it quickly.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:56.129
So, pretty short but let's see what
happens if I click on "Check". OK. It says I

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.059
got three points out of five and, well,
how does the content type do that?

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.430
Right now it's still pretty dumb. It just
checks for some keywords that you have

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.070
to define before and then it counts them
and then it returns the number. Yeah, but

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.170
let's see what you can configure
yourself actually. So I'll just jump to

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.770
the edit screen. Okay, so this is what the
content type looks like. Of course, you can

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.539
change the task description and the
placeholder text, and you can also limit

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.380
the number of characters that the
students may use if you'd like to, but

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.979
the more important stuff is done here. So
you can add keywords like Bilbo our Gandalf.

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.679
And you could also add phrases if
you like to. Maybe, I don't know, Lord of

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:49.009
the Rings maybe you could fit here. And
the content type would look for that and

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.759
then you have situations like this. There
are different spellings of "dwarfs", I

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:01.740
looked that up, both are correct and both
should lead to a point. And similar thing

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.729
down here: You can have "journey" and
"quest" and maybe you could also add

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.760
"adventure" and they are similar things.
And if you want to look for that, yeah,

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.250
you can add alternatives. Okay it can become a little tricky, of course. Maybe you also

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.560
want to look for for "journey" at the
beginning of a sentence and you'll have

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.870
a capital "J". So there's an option to
activate or deactivate case sensitivity.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.810
So, this helps a little bit. And I'm also
going to add another option, so you can

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.459
do something like a fuzzy search. That's
what computer scientists call it.

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:45.390
So, maybe plural would also be correct
like journeys or quests and maybe there

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.620
are also other variations of a word that
you'd like to include but you don't want

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.500
to type them in all by yourself, so
that's why I'm going to include that

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.849
option. I, well, we'll have to see how
good it works in practice.

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.650
Well, what else do we have? Down here
that's just the localization stuff, so

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.200
you could change the label for the check button. I could be submit or for

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.239
example and well you can change that
as well.

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:23.590
And, I, well that's about it. I have lots
of ideas what I could do, yeah, but I'd

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.269
like to hear yours. So if you have ideas
what you could use this content type

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:34.180
for or maybe what option you'd like to
see, yeah, just use the comment section

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:42.969
below, leave the comment and, yeah, tell me your ideas. That's it for today. Enjoy H5P!

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:47.040
Take care. Bye-bye!
