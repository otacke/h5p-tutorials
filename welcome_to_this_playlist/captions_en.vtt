Hey everybody!

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.730
My name is Oliver and I've been coding for
H5P for quite some time now and recently some

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.040
people have asked me: "Could you possibly do
some tutorial videos?" and I think I can and

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.040
I will.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.520
But I'd like to do a little more just for
fun.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.320
I'd like to demonstrate some features of H5P,
maybe even some sneak previews of features

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.470
that have not yet been released.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:41.750
I, maybe I, I'll show some coding stuff, I'm
not sure yet and you can help me with my decision

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.770
because there's lots of space in the comments
down below.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.520
Please use it and tell me what you'd like
to see and give me feedback if you think that

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.480
I can improve something.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.150
Um, yeah.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.240
I'd like to mention that all the videos that
I create will be licensed under a Creative

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.950
Commons license, so feel free to use them
and change them - whatever you like.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.750
Um, what else?

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.850
Oh, yeah, you noticed that I am not a native
speaker, I'm from Germany, and I thought about

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.530
doing these videos in German which would have
been much easier for me.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.350
Um, but I think I can reach more people if
I speak English - although it's not perfect,

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.720
but that no big deal.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.889
And YouTube has a cool feature: You can add
captions.

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:29.359
So, I can add English captions and I can add
German captions and you can add captions as

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:30.359
well.

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:35.600
If you're from France you can, for example,
add French captions which would be great.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.229
So just translate the English captions and
you're done.

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.709
It's pretty cool, pretty simple.

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:42.979
Um, yeah, what else?

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.270
If you like what I do and if you don't want
to miss a video, please subscribe to this channel,

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.319
but you know how that works.

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:55.390
And I just opened a site on Patreon, so if
you want to support me a little bit more,

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.869
more than just giving feedback, go to that
site - link is in the description below - have

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.359
a look and consider supporting me there.

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:05.659
Yeah, but I think that's about it, that's
what I wanna do.

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.819
Enjoy the channel, enjoy H5P!

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:09.929
Take care.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:10.429
Bye-bye!
